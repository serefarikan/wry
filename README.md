Grammar

See [wry grammar](grammars/Wry.g4).



Types
-----------

There are (at least) seven types: `Integer`, `Float`, `Bool`, `String`, `Null`, `Array`,
and `Function`. The `Array` type replaces what would be arrays, dictionaries, class
instances, and parameter lists in other languages. It is an ordered map and behaves
similarly to PHP's array type.

The simple types (`Integer`, `Float`, `Bool`, `String`, `Null`) will be familiar to users
of other languages, and can be created with literals that are obvious.

     count = 7
     radius = 13.6
     isChecked = false
     employee = "John Smith"
     flag = null

Those 5 simple types are scalars, whereas the `Array` type is a compound object.



### Arrays

Arrays are an ordered hashmap. That means it preserves the order of the keys as items are
inserted into the array. (Implementing it means something like a hashmap combined with
a linked list.)

To create an array, separate array elements with commas. A trailing comma is allowed, and
in fact is often useful to coerce something to an array.
An array can be a simple list of other types (no keys), in which case incrementing integer
keys will automatically be applied. Or it can be more like a dictionary with keys and
values, separate by colons and commas.
Keys are of type `String` or `Int`, or expressions that evaluate to one of these.
Entries in the array can be retrieved by key.

     employee = ('first': 'mike', 'last': 'weaver', 'empl-id': 1234, 10.5)

This syntax is similar to creating a dictionary in other languages, say JSON.
The parenthesis are needed because of operator precedence. Without them `employee` would
be the first item in a much different array, instead of being the name to which the array
is assigned.

An `Array` of items without keys is declared in a similar way:

     cutoffs = (15.0, 25.0, 47.0)

The items in the array are accessed with a subscript operator that uses square brackets.
Inside the brackets use an expression that evaluates to either an `Int` or `String` that
represents the key.

     cutoffs[0] // 15.0
     employee['first'] // 'mike'
     key = 'first'
     employee[key] // 'mike'

An alternate way to retrieve keyed items in the array uses a dot syntax. In this case, the
key for the item must be a string that is also a valid name.

     employee.first // equivalent to employee['first']

[MAYBE:]

Multiple items can be accessed using multiple items in the subscript, separated by commas.
Expressions that resolve to other than String or Integer will emit a warning.

     cutoffs[0, 2] //  0 and 1
     employee['first', 'empl-id']

The two expressions above, instead of returning a single item from the original array,
will each return an array with two items.
Integer indices in the returned array will be reset to 0, but string keys will be
preserved from the original.
(... or, why not preserve integer indices? we can always have a method to "reset" array
indices if that is desirable.)

[:MAYBE]

Alternate array declaration syntax:

Arrays keys can be declared in different ways. The following are equivalent:

     mydata = ('name': 'mike', 'age': 15)
     mydata = (name='mike', age=15)
     name = 'mike'
     age = 15
     mydata = (~name, ~age)
     mydata
          name = 'mike'
          age = 15
     mydata
          'name': 'mike'
          'age': 15
     'mydata': ('name': 'mike', 'age': 15)

So when declaring keys, one can use a string, or an expression that evaluates to a string,
followed by a colon.
Or one can use a bare name (no quotes) and an equals sign.
Or one can use multiple lines and indentation to layout the structure of the array.
A tilde preceding a bare name converts it as follows: `~name` is expanded to
`'name': name` where the expression on the left is a string, and the expression on the
right will be evaluated.

I was also thinking of an instance where, using indentation, if we need a non-named array
we can use a bare comma:

     people
          ,   // The other thing I was thinking here is to use empty brackets: []
               'name': 'mike'
               'age': 42
          ,   // Another option might be to use a bare underscore: _
               'name': 'fred'
               'age': 34

A bare expression (something that is not part of an assignment statement) will act as an
assignment into the local scope, using the next integer key.

Do we need syntax for appending to an array? PHP makes this simple using empty brackets to
represent "then next available slot".

     b[] = "next"

Do we want something like that? I'm currently thinking we use the `+` operator:

     b += 'next'

     a = b + ( 'surname' : 'thompson' )

What if we need to declare an array of arrays? I think we can do that with parens and
trailing commas:

     b = (1, 2, 3)
     c = b + 4
     d = b + (4,5,6)
     e = b + ((4,5,6),)



### Local Scope

Whatever the current scope is, its variables can be accessed via `$loc`, as follows:

     $loc['a']['name'] = 'Fred'
     print $loc.a['name']
     print $loc.a.name
     print $loc['a'].name

Normally, the search to resolve a name will start with `$loc`, so usually it is not
necessary to explicitly reference it.

This works:

     $loc['count'] = 100
     start = 0
     stop = count

Another way to affect the scope is the `with` statement. This is also a way to append to
an array. All of these are equivalent. The `with` statement makes the array `a` the local
scope and expressions and statements affect `a`.

     a.name = 'Fred'
     a['name'] = 'Fred'
     with a
          name = 'Fred'

Conceptually the `with` statement is pushing a new scope (for `a`) onto the scope stack
and then popping it off after the with block is done. Any assignments or bare expressions
will affect the current scope, `a`. This makes it easy to construct an array and use
branching statements to conditionally add elements to the array.

     hasSurname = true
     a
          name = 'Fred
          if needsSurname surname = "Thompson"

We can also use the `with` statement to create a temporary scope where we may override
values outside. I'm not sure how I want that syntax to look:

	func bailout
		...

	with
		func bailout   // Overrides the bailout function at the outer level.
			...
			...
		bailout()

	bailout()   // Calls the original, outer `bailout`.

Maybe a "bare" `with` as above. Or maybe a `with` statement followed by an underscore. We
should also allow for labels in case we want to be able to refer to overriden values at
specific points in the hierarchy. (Which begs the question, how do we refer to the outermost
$out if we are several levels deep?) (This also begs the question, why would you need/want to
do this?)



### Importing files

Scripts can be split into multiple files and then included inside one another. We want to
be able to include a file, but keep it somewhat isolated from the current scope, to avoid
collisions. When a file is included, using the `wind` statement, it create a new level
in the scope hierarchy. The current hierarchy is pushed, or "wound", up the stack; the
included file is executed in its own scope, and then _that_ is wound up the stack and a
new scope level opened for the rest of the script.

This allows one, for example, to set variables prior to the `wind` statment that will affect
the execution of the imported file, and still be available (if not overridden) to later
parts of the script. It also allows the author to override something in the included file,
because the override is happening at the current (lower) scope level. A wind statement can
include a label so one can refer back to objects explicitly at that level. As with the above
discussion on local scope, this begs the question of how we refer to a scope that has been
pushed above a `wind` or `with` statment. Perhaps we allow for a label like this:

	#script

	...

	wind 'include/inc-standard.wry' #standard

	func bailout   // This overrides the function defined in 'inc-standard'.
		@standard.bailout()   // Call the overridden function <- need to think about syntax,

	@script.some_var

The act of pushing (or winding) the scope up the stack will be triggered by a `wind` statement
and also by EOF.

Similar to the bare `with` above (and maybe, replacing it) would be a bare `wind` statement
which would push the current scope up the stack and open up a new one. This would let you
override something in the current scope, but still make it available if needed.

	#current

	myFunc = ...   // define something

	wind

	myFunc = ...   // will override (but not replace) the prior one

	myFunc()

	@current.myFunc()   // reaches back to version defined prior to `wind`

Another idea is to include the labels with the wind statement itself. So `wind` looks like
	wind [label for previous scope] [label for new scope]

with some sort of syntax to distinguish between those two, or only use one or the other
as desired.

### Loops

2018-04-26: I'm thinking instead of `continue`, the keyword to loop back should be
`repeat`, which meaning is a little more obvious.

There are two loop statements, `do`, and `for`. `for` takes an array and iterates through
the elements of the array, providing variables `$key` and `$val` to the statements inside
the block at each iteration. The `for` statement, unlike `do`, does *NOT* need an explicit
`continue` at the bottom. Question: should `$val` be a reference to the array element,
instead of a copy? One could always access the original object using the `$key`.

2018-04-26: With `for` loops, if they are nested, we need to distinguish between `$key`
and `$val` at different levels. Perhaps the `for` loop needs a way to specify what variables we
want to use, and `$key` and `$val` are the defaults if not specified.

	for array_of_stuff
		// we can use $key and $val

	for array_of_stuff as index : value
		// now we can use variables index and value.

	for array_of_stuff #outer
		for $val #inner
			// here we can use $key and $val, but also
			// @outer.$key and @outer.$val ????

The `do` statement begins a block of code that can be repeated with a `continue` statement
somewhere inside the block. The `do` block can also be exited with a `break` statement. If
the block is never "broken" out of, then an optional, trailing `then` block will be
executed. But if a `break` occurs, the `then` block will be skipped. (`break`, `continue`,
and `then` also apply the same to a `for` block.)

     do
          <some stuff>
          if <expression> continue   // Skip the remaining statements and start loop over.
          <some stuff>
          if <expression> break   // Stop iterating and jump past the `then` block.
          continue
     then
          <some stuff>   // Will only be executed if there was no `break` above.

Many loops will start with a test, similar to a standard `while` statement in C:

     do
          if !<while-condition> break
          ...

To keep the syntax clean (and prevent excessive indenting), a special form of the `do`
statement allows for a test at the top of the loop:

     do if <condition>
          <some stuff>
     then
          <some stuff>   // Executed even if we fail the condition, as long as no break.

It's very common to have an incrementing statement right before continue, such as:

     i = 0
     do if i < max
          <statements>
          i += 1
          continue

To clean that up a bit, both `continue` and `break` allow for a statement after, to
capture change to the iterator variable, for example.

     i = 0
     do if i<max
          <some stuff>
          continue i += 1

This nicely keeps the logic controlling the loop close to the important `do-if` and
`continue` statements.

Both `do` and `for` statements can be given a label, and `break` and `continue` can refer
to that label in order to break out of nested loops.

     do #outer
          <some stuff>
          do #inner
               <some stuff>
               if <expression> break #outer // Wait, syntactically speaking, do we need the octothorp?
          <some stuff>
     then
          <stuff>   // won't be called if we broke out of the #outer loop

The label always comes at the end of the line, so `do-if` has its test expression first,
then the label. And `continue` could have an optional incrementing statement first, then
the label, if any.

If we do exceptions, then we will "throw" an array, and we can test the array, using
`$exc`, to determine how we want to handle it in the `catch` clause, like so

     try
          <some stuff>
     catch if $exc.name == 'error'
          <stuff>
     catch if $exc.name == 'blahblahblah'
          <stuff>
     catch
          <stuff>   // for all other exceptions

I don't think we'll need a `finally` statement, because we'll adopt the concept of `defer`
from Swift.



### Object Serializing

Maybe we can borrow from the ideas behind dStruct and create a mechanism to save arrays in
a database. There can be some initialization files or configuration files that grant the
script access to a database, and then simple calls like this will make objects permanent
from one run of the script to another:

     $dbs['person'] += ('name': 'Mike', 'age': 24)

     for $dbs['persons']
          <do something with all the persons returned from the database>

I think to make this work, we'll need hooks that are called when array items are `set` or
`get`. Those could be buried away and hidden from the user, or made available for anyone
to take advantage of them.

I'm thinking something similar (`$fil`) will be used to manage access to the file system.



### Functions

To create a function, use the keyword `func` to open a new block and then write
statements in an indented block that follows.
```
     func celsiusFromFahrenheit
          return ($0-32.0)*5.0/9.0
```
Calling the function is accomplished by appending parenthesis after a name. The
parenthesis can be empty, or they can contain array entries that will be passed in as
arguments and available inside the function via `$arg`.

You can also compose an array with a function call, and the array will be available inside
the function as `$obj`. Inside the function, name resolution follows a search path through
`$loc`, `$arg`, `$obj`, and finally `$out`. These arrays can be referenced explicitly or
searching will happen implicitly in the given order. Note that `$arg` is read-only,
whereas `$obj` is a reference to the original object, so changes to `$obj` inside the
function will be visible outside (or after) the function.

When passing similarly named arguments from one function to another, the tilde syntax
(`~name`) becomes very useful. And if an entire array needs to be passed, used double
tilde syntax: `~~name`.

When an array, `b`, is composed with a function, the search to resolve the function name
begins in `b` and then (if not found) search begins in the local scope. The result is that
composing becomes a natural way to call functions that are defined inside an array. (It
behaves like member lookup.)

Suppose we have an array `p` in the local scope that has been set up as a Person object,
with a first and last name, and a function `fullName`. Ignoring for the moment how we set
up this object, we would call the `fullName` method like so:

     s = p->fullName()

Because of the compose operator, the process of resolving the name "fullName" will begin
with `p`, where it will indeed find a function under the key "fullName". The function will
be called with `p` as the `$obj`. If instead we did any of the following:

     p.fullName()
     p['fullName']()

the function would be found and called, but it would not have the `$obj` array as expected
and would probably produce meaningless results. We can "hijack" the function, being able
to make a good guess what it does, and do something strange like this:

     imposter = ( 'firstName': 'Mike', 'lastName': 'Smith' )
     imposter->p.fullName()

and would probably get the results we expected. Now the `fullName` function has an `$obj`
array with the entries it expects to see.

This is sort of a convoluted example because if all we really cared about was composing
a full name, we might want to pass first and last names in as (read-only) arguments,
rather than composing with an object. But here we are trying to provide an example of an
object (the Person) that includes data and functions to work on that data.
So there you go.

Related to this, if we have a function with the same name defined in the local
scope, it *won't* get called by the straightforward composition operator. We instead have
to explicitly refer to it's containing scope (`$loc`), like so:

     p->$loc.fullName()

Some functions don't need named parameters, so a simple array object can be provided.
Internally, the function refers to the arguments with an automatic variable `$args`.

     func sum
          t = 0
          for $args t += $val
          return t

The `for` block operates on an array in a loop, and at each iteration provides variables
`$key` and `$val` for the current entry.

     total = sum(1, 2, 3, 4) // returns 10

Often the variables we use to construct an array share the same name as the key we
use in the array:

     values = ( 'name' : name, 'id' : id, )

For this case we have a shortcut syntax using the tilde (`~`):

     key = 'class'
     value = 'ampm'
     a = ( 'key' : key, 'value' : value)
     // or
     a = ( ~key, ~value)

A function can return a value, using the `return` statement. If a function does not
explicitly return a value and is chained to another function, then the original `$obj`
scope will be passed to the next function in the chain. If it returns a value, however,
then that value will take over and replace the `$obj` scope for the next function in the
chain. (Note that a function that returns a value is interpreted, at the call site, as an
expression and the returned value will be added to the current scope.)

Suppose we have this function defined:

     func transformer
          $obj['name'] ?= "anonymous"

Note: The `?=` operator tests if a name is defined and, if not, assigns the value on the
right.

     some_array -> transformer() -> print()

The above passes the object to transformer, which inserts a 'name' key (if it doesn't
exist already) and, by lacking a return statement, implicitly passes it's original `$obj`
as the `$obj` to the next function.

The idea here is that composing allows you to change the original array. Values passed in
as arguments aren't intended to be changed (they can be, but the changes die when the
function exits).

Closures. I think we can achieve something similar to closures by composing an object with
a function, but not calling the function. The resulting value will be--what should we call
it, a `Composition`?--something that can be executed but already has it's `$obj` bundled
with it. Really it's a function with some extra data tagging along with it. You can even
compose something with it when you call it, and the earlier composition will still be
first in the scope resolution hierarchy.

If the function is a member of an array, then other properties of that array should be
available to the function by default. (They will be, under composition, because they will
be found in `$obj`, as long as they are not hidden by something in `$loc` or `$arg`, which
are checked first.)

Here is an example from PHP and wCommon. We have a function, `addButtons`, that takes
an array of button definitions (each of those is itself an array), rearranges the info for
each button into the standard parts of an HTML element, and calls `addElement` to add the
button to our eventual HTML output (also wrapping it in its own 'p' element). `addButtons`
is defined in a 'FormBuilder' object that has a member, `cp`, a Composer, to accumulate
the HTML output. So in the PHP code, `$this` refers to the FormBuilder, and `cp` is its
member.

Here is how this function looks in PHP:

     // in PHP
     function addButtons($butts) {
          $this->cp->beginElement('p');
          foreach ($butts as $items) {
               if (!$items['type']) { $items['type'] = 'submit'; }
               if (!$items['name']) { $items['name'] = self::KEY_ACTION; }
               if (!$items['id']) { $items['id'] = $items['name'] . '-' . $items['value']; }
               $attribs = array_intersect_key($items, array_flip('type', 'name', 'id', 'value'));
               $attribs = array_merge($attribs, $items['xattr']);
               $this->cp->addElement('button', $attribs, $items['content']);
          }
          $this->cp->endElement();
     }

If a button wasn't defined with a 'type', then it gets the default 'submit'. A default
'name' is similarly supplied. If it doesn't have an 'id', then one is created by
concatenating 'name' and 'value'. The caller can pass in extra attributes (such as "class"
or "onclick") via 'xattr'. And so on (you can go check it out in
[wCommon](https://github.com/wevrem/wCommon) for more details).

And here is how it could look in wry:

     // in wry
     func addButtons   // pass in an array of button objects
          cp->beginElement('p')
          for $args
               $val.type ?= 'submit'
               $val.name ?= keyAction
               $val.id ?= $val.name + '-' + $val.value
               attribs = $val['type', 'id', 'name', 'value'] + $val.xattr
               cp->addElement('button', ~attribs, ~$val.content)
          cp->endElement()


We would call this function like so:

     buttons
          value='submit', content='Submit'
          value='cancel', content='Cancel'

     fb->addButtons(buttons)

where `fb` is an object representing a `FormBuilder`.

With records, *a la* [SAM](https://github.com/mbakeranalecta/sam), we could even do this:

     buttons :: value, content
          'submit', 'Submit'
          'cancel', 'Cancel'

Let's look at the function that the one above relies on, it is `getElement` in the
composer object. This has an interesting (and probably poorly designed) signature where it
will accept an array of attributes, but if instead the caller passes a string, it will be
interpreted as a "class" attribute and an attribute array constructed from it.
This makes it convenient to call the function with a
simple class name (which will often be the use case) instead of having to construct an
array around that class name. In wry we don't have to do those sorts of gymnastics.

     // in PHP
     protected static function getElement($elem, $attribs=[], $content='', $close=false) {
          if (is_string($attribs)) { $attribs = [ 'class'=>$attribs ]; }
          else if (!is_array($attribs)) { $attribs = []; }
          if ($class = $attribs['class']) { self::registerClass($class); }
          $attribString = implode(' ', array_key_map('attribParam', array_filter($attribs, 'is_not_null')));   //(1)
          if (self::isEmptyElement($elem)) {
               return '<' . $elem . prefixIfCe($attribString, ' ') . ' />';
          } else {
               return '<' . $elem . prefixIfCe($attribString, ' ') . '>' . $content . ( $close ? "</$elem>" : '' );
          }
     }

     // in wry
     func getElement   //(elem, class?, attribs?, content?, close?=false)
          if class attribs.class = class
          registerClass(attribs.class)
          s
               "<" + $0 + " "
               attribs->filtered()->mapped(composeAttrib)->joined(' ')   //(1)
               if emptyElements->contains($0) " />"
               else
                    ">" + content
                    if close "</" + $0 + ">"
          return s->joined()
     }

In both versions, the logic at (1) turns the array of keys and values into a string that
will work as
attributes of an HTML tag, like so:

     key1="val1" key2="val2" ...

The helper functions would be defined as follows. Note that the function passed in to
`mapped` will be called with two arguments: `key` and `val`.

     func composeAttrib
          return key + '="' + val + '"'

Note: this is an example of something cool: when we have to generate a string from pieces
and have logic that turns on or off pieces, the simple way to do it is to declare an array
in a block, and make use of flow control statements inside the block. Then at the end we
join the pieces of the array.

Composing can be chained: `firstArray -> secondArray -> myFunc` means both arrays will end
up being sent as `$obj` to the function `myFunc`.
Inside `myFunc`, `$obj` will be a composition of both arrays, not that `myFunc` will be
able to distinguish them. Really it means that when resolving names, `secondArray` will be
searched first and `firstArray` will be searched last. Name lookup to retrieve a value
will work its way down the chain. Name lookup for assignment will stop at the first level
of the hierarchy.

You can pre-compose and then pass that to a function later:

     new_array = firstArray -> secondArray

     new_array->doSomething()

Composition preserves references to objects, so `new_array` contains a reference to the
two originals, and and they are combined in a hierarchy, like a stack.

What do you get when you compose different things?

     myArray -> anotherArray   // returns an array that combines both `myArray` and `anotherArray`.
     // They won't be merged, they will be arranged more like a stack with `anotherArray`
     // at the top and, thus, searched first.

     anArray -> aFunction   // returns a function with `anArray` composed as its `$obj`

     anArray -> map(mapFunc)   // this composes `anArray` with, and then calls, the `map` function

     anArray->myFunc<myArgs>   // composes `anArray` with `myFunc` using arguments `myArgs`
     // but does not execute the function

Arguments can be composed with a function, but the function not called, by using `<` and
`>` around the arguments. If the result is further composed with arguments, or the
function later called with arguments, the most recent arguments will "win" (because `$arg`
is not stacked up like `$obj`, there is only ever one `$arg` attached to a function so
multiple compositions will just combine `$arg`s).

If a non-array item is thrown into a composition, it will first be converted to an array,
using default integer keys.

### Comments

Two slashes create a comment to the end of the line.
I don't think we'll have multi-line comments like `/**/`.
Instead, the keyword `comment` will change the line where it appears *and all indented lines below*
into comments. This make it easy to comment out a block of code, you just prepend `comment`

	comment do
		...some stuff...

The `comment` comments out the `do` and all the code belonging to the `do` block.	

### Values and References

Arrays exhibit reference semantics, but standard operations will produce copies of things:

	a = ( name='mike', age='42' )
	b = a

The above will make a _copy_ of `a`, referred to as `b`. If you change either `a` or `b`, it
won't affect the other.

	a.name->print()   // prints 'mike'
	b.name->print()   // prints 'mike'
	a.name = 'tom'
	a.name->print()   // still prints 'mike'
	b.name->print()   // now prints 'tom'

Actually in the run-time, `b` refers to `a`, but it is a read-only reference. Writing to either
`a` or `b` will mask the original values. Here is how that works:

Let `A` represent the array we created above, with keys 'name' and 'age'. Originally, variable `a`
points to that array, so

	a --> A

when the runtime encounters the statement `b = a` it alters `a` by chaining with an empty array

	a --> [] --> A

and `b` similarly becomes

	b --> [] --> A

Both `b` and `a` point to `A`, but there is an empty array first in each chain. When looking up
key `name`, the search will skip the empty array and find the value in `A` (which is how
we achieve a read-only reference). When we write to either `b` or `a`, the assignment will
happen at the bottom of the chain, in the empty array. Thus they share an original reference,
but can't clobber each other with writes.

How do we make a change that we know will affect the original `A`, even if shared by
different references? We have to use chaining and tags.

	b = a -> []

or

	b <- a

2018-04-26: Hmm... I don't like this. I think for reference semantics we should have a
different operator, like &= that makes one object refer to another. Think about it.

Now if we make a change to `a`, it will be visible from `b`.

	a.name = 'tom'
	b.name->print()   // prints 'tom'

Using our "pointer" diagrams, this is what happens when we execute `b <- a`:

	a --> A
	b --> [] --> A

In this case, `a` still points directly to `A` with no empty array sitting in between.
So changes through `a` are visible in `b`, which was not the case above. However, those changes
are one-sided. If we make a change to `b` it will not affect `a`. To achieve that we need
to use tags:

	b <- a#orig
	b@orig.name = 'tom'

This is what the pointers look like:

	a --> A
	b --> [] --> A#orig

Now the badge on `b` jumps over the empty array and makes changes directly in `a`.

This is how we would, for example, maintain a shared counter.

	counter#base
		count = 0
		func incrementCounter
			$0 ?= 1
			@base.count += $0

	a <- counter

	b <- counter

	a->incrementCounter(1)

	b->incrementCounter(5)

To make this work, we have to set an explicit tag on `counter`, and reference that tag
within the `incrementCounter` method.

As part of this, I think we need to be able to use references with tags and badges. Maybe
with parens:

	counter#(theBaseName)

		...   // inside the function
		@(theBaseName).count

We should be able to put tags on items as they are declared, like we did above with `counter`
and also when composing. Those tags should not clobber each other. So maybe each chain keeps
track of what tags have been added (meaning if we tag an item like `counter` above it will
be automatically converted into a chain with the tag) and then when composed later with other
things, those chains will have slots for additional tags.

Do we need to distinguish between chains formed by the runtime (for example, for copy-on-write and
tagged objects as described above) and those formed explicitly by the user? Or does it matter?
