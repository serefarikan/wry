Questions
-----------

Do we allow assignment to be an operator that returns a value? That is how it works in
PHP, but in Swift it is forbidden (not by the grammar, by the way, but by something else
downstream from the parser). But I find it useful to be able to capture a value at the
same time as testing and then use that captured value:

     a = <some hairy expression>
     if a { // assuming we can test `a` even if it is not strictly a boolean value
          <do something with a>
     }

     if a = <some hairy expression> {
          <do something with a>
     }

Do we to allow any expression as condition-clauses? or only those that return boolean
values? PHP has a broad set of things it will consider `false`, including empty strings,
empty arrays, zero; whereas Lua only considers `false` and `nil` to be false and all those
others are considered true. How do we handle a condion-clause that evaluates to an array?
Do all the members of the array have to be true to continue?  (In PHP it only depends on
whether or not the array is empty.)

Maybe we say: whatever expression is there in the condition clause will be cast (coerced)
to a boolean, and there is a set of rules that control that. Maybe for an array, the first
item of the array is used to determine the boolean. In PHP an array is true if it isn't
empty.

As of 2017-03-01 my thoughts on this subject have landed on this: assignments are
statements. The condition in an `if` test must be expressions, so assignment is not
allowed there. But that will have to be enforced by the interpreter, because currently in
the grammar, assignment is a type of expression (it has to be that way for declaring
arrays).



Types
-----------

There are (at least) seven types: `Integer`, `Float`, `Bool`, `String`, `Null`, `Array`,
and `Function`. The `Array` type replaces what would be arrays, dictionaries, class
instances, and parameter lists in other languages. It is an ordered map and behaves
similarly to PHP's array type.

The simple types (`Integer`, `Float`, `Bool`, `String`, `Null`) will be familiar to users
of other languages, and can be created with literals that are obvious.

     count = 7
     radius = 13.6
     isChecked = false
     employee = "John Smith"
     flag = null

Those 5 simple types are scalars, whereas the `Array` type is a compound object.



### Arrays

Arrays are an ordered hashmap. That means it preserves the order of the keys as items are
inserted into the array. (Implementing it means something like a hashmap combined with
a linked list.)

To create an array, separate array elements with commas. A trailing comma is allowed.
An array can be a simple list of other types (no keys), in which case incrementing integer
keys will automatically be applied. Or it can be more like a dictionary with keys and
values, separate by colons and commas.
Keys are of type `String` or `Int`, or expressions that evaluate to one of these.
Entries in the array can be retrieved by key.

     employee = ('first': 'mike', 'last': 'weaver', 'empl-id': 1234, 10.5)

This syntax is similar to creating a dictionary in other languages, say JSON.
The parenthesis are needed because of operator precedence. Without them `employee` would
be the first item in a much different array, instead of being the name to which the array
is assigned.

An `Array` of items without keys is declared in a similar way:

     cutoffs = (15.0, 25.0, 47.0)

The items in the array are accessed with a subscript operator that uses square brackets.
Inside the brackets use an expression that evaluates to either an `Int` or `String` that
represents the key.

     cutoffs[0] // 15.0
     employee['first'] // 'mike'
     key = 'first'
     employee[key] // 'mike'

An alternate way to retrieve keyed items in the array uses a dot syntax. In this case, the
key for the item must be a string that is also a valid name.

     employee.first // equivalent to employee['first']

[MAYBE:]

Multiple items can be accessed using multiple items in the subscript, separated by commas.
Expressions that resolve to other than String or Integer will emit a warning.

     cutoffs[0, 2] //  0 and 1
     employee['first', 'empl-id']

The two expressions above, instead of returning a single item from the original array,
will each return an array with two items.
Integer indices in the returned array will be reset to 0, but string keys will be
preserved from the original.
(... or, why not preserve integer indices? we can always have a method to "reset" array
indices if that is desirable.)

[:MAYBE]

Alternate array declaration syntax:

Arrays keys can be declared in different ways. The following are equivalent:

     mydata = ('name': 'mike', 'age': 15)
     mydata = (name='mike', age=15)
     name = 'mike'
     age = 15
     mydata = (~name, ~age)
     mydata
          name='mike'
          age=15
     mydata
          'name': 'mike'
          'age': 15
     'mydata': ('name': 'mike', 'age': 15)

So when declaring keys, one can use a string, or an expression that evaluates to a string,
followed by a colon.
Or one can use a bare name (no quotes) and an equals sign.
Or one can use multiple lines and indentation to layout the structure of the array.
A tilde preceding a bare name converts it as follows: `~name` is expanded to
`'name': name`.

I was also thinking of an instance where, using indentation, if we need a non-named array
we can use a bare comma:

     people
          ,   // The other thing I was thinking here is to use empty brackets: []
               'name': 'mike'
               'age': 42
          ,   // Another option might be to use a bare underscore: _
               'name': 'fred'
               'age': 34

What if we need to declare an array of arrays? I think we can do that with parens and
trailing commas:

     b = (1, 2, 3)
     c = b + 4
     d = b + (4,5,6)
     e = b + ((4,5,6),)

A bare expression (something that is not part of an assignment statement) will act as an
assignment into the local scope, using the next integer key.

Do we need syntax for appending to an array? PHP makes this simple using empty brackets to
represent "then next available slot".

     b[] = "next"

Do we want something like that? I'm currently thinking we use the `+` operator:

     b += 'next'

     a = b + ( 'surname' : 'thompson' )



### Local Scope

Whatever the current scope is, it's variables can be accessed via `$loc`, as follows:

     $loc['a']['name'] = 'Fred'
     print $loc.a['name']
     print $loc.a.name
     print $loc['a'].name

Normally, the search to resolve a name will start with `$loc`, so usually it is not
necessary to explicitly reference it.

This works:

     $loc['count'] = 100
     start = 0
     stop = count

Another way to affect the scope is the `with` statement. This is also a way to append to
an array. All of these are equivalent. The `with` statement makes the array `a` the local
scope and expressions and statements affect `a`.

     a.name = 'Fred'
     a['name'] = 'Fred'
     with a
          name = 'Fred'

Conceptually the `with` statement is pushing a new scope (for `a`) onto the scope stack
and then popping it off after the with block is done. Any assignments or bare expressions
will affect the current scope, `a`. This makes it easy to construct an array and use
branching statements to conditionally add elements to the array.

     hasSurname = true
     a
          name = 'Fred
          if hasSurname surname = "Thompson"



### Loops

There are two loop statements, `do`, and `for`. `for` takes an array and iterates through
the elements of the array, providing variables `$key` and `$val` to the statements inside
the block at each iteration. The `for` statement, unlike `do`, does *NOT* need an explicit
`continue` at the bottom. Question: should `$val` be a reference to the array element,
instead of a copy? One could always access the original object using the `$key`.

The `do` statement begins a block of code that can be repeated with a `continue` statement
somewhere inside the block. The `do` block can also be exited with a `break` statement. If
the block is never "broken" out of, then an optional, trailing `then` block will be
executed. But if a `break` occurs, the `then` block will be skipped. (`break`, `continue`,
and `then` also apply the same to a `for` block.)

     do
          <some stuff>
          if <expression> continue   // skip the remaining statements and start loop over
          <some stuff>
          if <expression> break   // stop iterating and jump past the `then` block
          continue
     then
          <some stuff>   // these will only be executed if there was no `break` above

Many loops will start with a test, similar to a standard `while` statement in C:

     do
          if !<while-condition> break
          ...

To keep the syntax clean (and prevent excessive indenting), a special form of the `do`
statement allows for a test at the top of the loop:

     do if <condition>
          <some stuff>
     then
          <some stuff>   // executed even if we fail the condition, as long as no break

It's very common to have an incrementing statement right before continue, such as:

     i = 0
     do if i < max
          <statements>
          i += 1
          continue

To clean that up a bit, both `continue` and `break` allow for a statement after, to
capture change to the iterator variable, for example.

     i = 0
     do if i<max
          <some stuff>
          continue i += 1

This nicely keeps the logic controlling the loop close to the important `do-if` and
`continue` statements.

Both `do` and `for` statements can be given a label, and `break` and `continue` can refer
to that label in order to break out of nested loops.

     do #outer
          <some stuff>
          do #inner
               <some stuff>
               if <expression> break #outer
          <some stuff>
     then
          <stuff>   // won't be called if we broke out of the #outer loop

The label always comes at the end of the line, so `do-if` has its test expression first,
then the label. And `continue` could have an optional incrementing statement first, then
the label, if any.

If we do exceptions, then we will "throw" an array, and we can test the array, using
`$exc`, to determine how we want to handle it in the `catch` clause, like so

     try
          <some stuff>
     then
          <stuff>   // if no exception thrown
     catch if $exc.name == 'error'
          <stuff>
     catch if $exc.name == 'blahblahblah'
          <stuff>
     catch
          <stuff>   // for all other exceptions

I don't think we'll need a `finally` statement, because we'll adopt the concept of `defer`
from Swift.



### Object Serializing

Maybe we can borrow from the ideas behind dStruct and create a mechanism to save arrays in
a database. There can be some initialization files or configuration files that grant the
script access to a database, and then simple calls like this will make objects permanent
from one run of the script to another:

     $dbs['person'] += ('name': 'Mike', 'age': 24)

     for $dbs['persons']
          <do something with all the persons returned from the database>

I think to make this work, we'll need hooks that are called when array items are `set` or
`get`. Those could be buried away and hidden from the user, or made available for anyone
to take advantage of them.

I'm thinking something similar ($fil) will be used to manage access to the file system.



### Functions

To create a function, use the keyword `func` to open a new block and then write
statements in an indented block that follows.

     func celsiusFromFahrenheit
          return ($0-32.0)*5.0/9.0

Calling the function is accomplished by appending parenthesis after a name. The
parenthesis can be empty, or they can contain array entries that will be passed in as
arguments and available inside the function via `$arg`.

You can also compose an array with a function call, and the array will be available inside
the function as `$obj`. Inside the function, name resolution follows a search path through
`$loc`, `$arg`, `$obj`, and finally `$out`. These arrays can be referenced explicitly or
searching will happen implicitly in the given order. Note that `$arg` is read-only,
whereas `$obj` is a reference to the original object, so changes to `$obj` inside the
function will be visible outside (or after) the function.

When passing similar args from one function to another, the tilde syntax (`~name`) becomes
very useful. And if an entire array needs to be passed, used double tilde syntax:
`~~name`.

When an array, `b`, is composed with a function, the search to resolve the function name
begins in `b` and then (if not found) search begins in the local scope. The result is that
composing becomes a natural way to call functions that are defined inside an array. (It
behaves like member lookup.)

Suppose we have an array `p` in the local scope that has been set up as a Person object,
with a first and last name, and a function `fullName`. Ignoring for the moment how we set
up this object, we would call the `fullName` method like so:

     s = p->fullName()

Because of the compose operator, the process of resolving the name "fullName" will begin
with `p`, where it will indeed find a function under the key "fullName". The function will
be called with `p` as the `$obj`. If instead we did any of the following:

     p.fullName()
     p['fullName']()

the function would be found and called, but it would not have the `$obj` array as expected
and would probably produce meaningless results. We can "hijack" the function, being able
to make a good guess what it does, and do something strange like this:

     imposter = ( 'firstName': 'Mike', 'lastName': 'Smith' )
     imposter->p.fullName()

and would probably get the results we expected. Now the `fullName` function has an `$obj`
array with the entries it expects to see.

As a corollary to this, if we have a function with the same name defined in the local
scope, it *won't* get called by the straightforward composition operator. We instead have
to explicitly refer to it's containing scope (`$loc`), like so:

     p->$loc.fullName()

Some functions don't need named parameters, so a simple array object can be provided.
Internally, the function refers to the arguments with an automatic variable `$args`.

     func sum
          t = 0
          for $args t += $val
          return t

The `for` block operates on an array in a loop, and at each iteration provides variables
`$key` and `$val` for the current entry.

     total = sum(1, 2, 3, 4) // returns 10

Often the variables we use to construct an array share the same name as the key we want to
use in the array:

     values = ( 'name' : name, 'id' : id, )

For this case we have a shortcut syntax using the tilde (`~`):

     key = 'class'
     value = 'ampm'
     a = ( 'key' : key, 'value' : value)
     // or
     a = ( ~key, ~value)

A function can return a value, using the `return` statement. If a function does not
explicitly return a value and is chained to another function, then the original `$obj`
scope will be passed to the next function in the chain. If it returns a value, however,
then that value will take over and replace the `$obj` scope for the next function in the
chain.

Suppose we have this function defined:

     func transformer
          $obj['name'] ?= "anonymous"

Note: The `?=` operator tests if a name is defined and, if not, assigns the value on the
right.

     some_array -> transformer() -> print()

The above passes the object to transformer, which inserts a 'name' key (if it doesn't
exist already) and, by lacking a return statement, implicitly passes it's original `$obj`
as the `$obj` to the next function.

The idea here is that composing allows you to change the original array. Values passed in
as arguments aren't intended to be changed (they can be, but the changes die when the
function exits).

Closures. I think we can achieve something similar to closures by composing an object with
a function, but not calling the function. The resulting value will be--what should we call
it, a `Composition`?--something that can be executed but already has it's `$obj` bundled
with it. Really it's a function with some extra data tagging along with it. You can even
compose something with it when you call it, and the earlier composition will still be
first in the scope resolution hierarchy.

If the function is a member of an array, then other properties of that array should be
available to the function by default. (They will be, under composition, because they will
be found in `$obj`, as long as they are not hidden by something in `$loc` or `$arg`, which
are checked first.)

Here is an example from PHP and wCommon. We have a function, `addButtons`, that takes
an array of button definitions (each of those is itself an array), rearranges the info for
each button into the standard parts of an HTML element, and calls `addElement` to add the
button to our eventual HTML output (also wrapping it in its own 'p' element).
Here is how this function looks in PHP:

     // in PHP
     function addButtons($butts) {
          $this->composer->beginElement('p');
          foreach ($butts as $items) {
               if (!$items['type']) { $items['type'] = 'submit'; }
               if (!$items['name']) { $items['name'] = self::KEY_ACTION; }
               if (!$items['id']) { $items['id'] = $items['name'] . '-' . $items['value']; }
               $attribs = array_merge(array_intersect_key($items, array_flip('type', 'name', 'id', 'value')), $items['xattr']);
               $this->composer->addElement('button', $items['class'], $attribs, $items['content']);
          }
          $this->composer->endElement();
     }

If a button wasn't defined with a 'type', then it gets the default 'submit'. A default
'name' is similarly supplied. If it doesn't have an 'id', then one is created by
concatenating 'name' and 'value'. The caller can pass in extra attributes via 'xattr'.
And so on (you can go check it out in wCommon for more details).

And here is how it could look in wry:

     // in wry
     func addButtons   // pass in an array of button objects
          composer.beginElement('p')
          for $args
               $val.type ?= 'submit'
               $val.name ?= keyAction
               $val.id ?= $val.name + '-' + $val.action
               attribs = $val['type', 'name', 'id', 'value'] + $val.xattr
               composer.addElement('button', ~$val.class, ~attribs, $val.content)
          composer.endElement()


We would call this function like so:

     buttons
          value='submit', content='Submit'
          value='cancel', content='Cancel'

     fb->addButtons(buttons)

where `fb` is an object representing a `FormBuilder`.

With records, *a la* SAM, we could even do this:

     buttons :: value, content
          'submit', 'Submit'
          'cancel', 'Cancel'

Let's look at the function that the one above relies on, it is `getElement` in the
composer object:

     // in PHP   //[2017-04-20: is this the latest version of this function?]
     protected static function getElement($elem, $class='', $attribs=[], $content='', $close=false) {
          $filtered = array_filter($attribs, function ($v) { return !empty($v); } );
          $attribString = implode(' ', array_map(function($k, $v) { return "$k=\"$v\""; }, array_keys($filtered), $filtered));
          $empty = self::isEmptyElement($elem);
          return '<' . $elem . wrapIfCe($class, ' class="', '"') . prefixIfCe($attribString, ' ') . ( $empty ? '' : '>' . $content ) . ( $close ? ( $empty ? ' />' : "</$elem>" ) : '' );
     }

     // in wry
     func getElement   //(elem, class?, attribs?, content?, close?=false)
          if class attribs.class = class
          s
               "<" + $0 + " "
               attribs->filtered(notEmpty)->mapped(composeAttrib)->joined(' ')
               if emptyElements->contains($0) " />"
               else
                    ">" + content
                    if close "</" + $0 + ">"
          return s->joined()
     }

Note: this is an example of something cool: when we have to generate a string from pieces
and have logic that turns on or off pieces, the simple way to do it is to declare an array
in a block, and make use of flow control statements inside the block. Then at the end we
join() the pieces of the array.

Composing can be chained: `firstArray -> secondArray -> myFunc` means both arrays will end
up being sent as args to the functin `myFunc`. No, they will not be sent as separate args.
Inside `myFunc`, `$obj` will be a composition of both arrays, not that `myFunc` will be
able to distinguish them. Really it means that when resolving names, `secondArray` will be
searched first and `firstArray` will be searched last. Name lookup to retrieve a value
will work its way up the chain. Name lookup for assignment will stop at the first level of
the hierarchy.

You can pre-compose and then pass that to a function later:

     new_array = firstArray -> secondArray

     new_array->doSomething()

Composition preserves references to objects, so `new_array` contains a reference to the
two originals, and and they are combined in a hierarchy, like a stack.

What do you get when you compose different things?

     myArray -> anotherArray   // returns an array that contains elements from both `myArray` and `anotherArray`. For any keys that are the same, they are organized into an hierarchy relationship, like a stack.

     anArray -> aFunction   // returns a function with `anArray` composed as its `$obj`

     anArray -> map(mapFunc)   // this composes `anArray` with the `map` function and then calls the `map` function

     anArray->myFunc<myArgs>   // composes `anArray` with `myFunc` and arguments `myArgs`, but does not execute the function

Arguments can be composed with a function, but the function not called, by using `<` and
`>` around the arguments. If the result is further composed with arguments, or the
function later called with arguments, the most recent arguments will "win" (because `$arg`
is not stacked up like `$obj`, there is only ever one `$arg` attached to a function so
multiple compositions will just combine `$arg`s).

If a non-array item is thrown into a composition, it will first be converted to an array,
using default integer keys.
