section : Block markers

	The following are all the common punctuation characters (on US English
	keyboards) for syntax, and how they are (or might be) used in wry.

	!!!
		Some things might want to include:

		*
			Ability to do lines with specified breaks or custom indentation, such
			as poetry. As an example, in SAM this is done with a pipe character at
			the beginning of the line:

			```
				| A pipe followed by a space
				|   indicates lines of text with
				| fixed line breaks and indentation

			An alternative would be to use a backslash to escape the indentation
			that is supposed to be part of the line and not part of the document
			structure.

		*
			Use `+++` to mark a table, with double colons as column delimiters. How
			do we mark the header row? Maybe the column delimiter could be pipe?

		*
			SAM uses the marker >>> as in insert for, as an example, an image. In
			wry this symbol is reserved for switching between prose and code mode,
			so can't be used for this purpose. But another marker could be used.
			Or, accomplish this another way, with a reference in text to a field
			that defines an image.

			```
				Some wry prose with image reference [*image name].

				image name : my_image.png

		*
			Equations could be handled with pre-composed text marker (three
			backticks) and same for inline, surrounded by backticks, but we don't
			want to see the specification in mono-spaced font, we actually want to
			see the rendered equation. Sam uses an equal sign in the attribute
			following the in-line code.

			```(SAM) : SAM syntax for inline renders
				Inline rendered content `\frac{a}{b}`(=latexmath).

			We could use a `===` marker to indicate "don't print this in
			mono-spaced font like a pre-composed block, but render it and replace".
			But what about inline? Could surround with equal signs, similar to how
			backticks are used to surround in-line pre-composed code. But that
			would get confusing, especially as it seems often the text we want to
			denote would include an equal sign. Could use angle brackets, showing a
			similarity between popping out of prose mode to some sort of code mode.
			Or could use curly brackets with an equal sign around the embedded
			text, which makes the equal sign "magic" inside curly braces. That
			problem exists with SAM's approach, where equal sign is magin in the
			attribute parens.
