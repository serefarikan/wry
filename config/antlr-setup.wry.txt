project : Antlr4 setup

section : Introduction

	This document outlines the steps I took to install and use Antlr4 on my local
	machine. So much time passes between opportunities to play around with
	grammars and Wry that I need help remembering what my environment was and the
	choices I made.

section : Install Antrl4

	Follow the directions at www.antlr.org to install Antlr. I did a local (not
	system-wide) install in `~/Document/Programming/Antlr4` and created a
	symbolic link to a generically named `antlr-current.jar`, then pointed
	aliases and classpath to that "current" jar.

	$$$
		cd <ANTLR-LOCATION>
		curl -0 https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar
		ln -s antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar antlr-current.jar
		vi ~/.bash_aliases
		alias antlr4='java -Xmx500M org.antlr.v4.Tool'
		alias grun='java org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig'
		:x
		vi ~/.bash_profile
		export CLASSPATH=".:<ANTLR-LOCATION>/antlr-current.jar:$CLASSPATH"
		:x

section : Running Antlr4

	The Wry project home is ~/Documents/Programming/wry Project` (a sibling
	directory of Antlr4), under which is the `build` directory where generated
	java class go. The grammars, including `TestDent`, live under the project
	home in `wry-github/grammars`. Thus to compile, say, `TestDent` grammar,
	execute the following:

	$$$
		antlr4 -o ../../build TestDent.g4

section : Compiling a grammar

	Change the build directory and run javac on the grammar files generated in the prior step.

	$$$
		javac TestDent*.java

section : Testing a grammar

	Test files live in `<wry project home>/wry-github/tests`. They can be
	executed all together with the following (from the build directory):

	$$$
		for i in ../wry-github/tests/*; do echo "$i"; grun TestDent script -tokens $i; done > results-TestDent.txt 2>&1
